# NOTE: D212 is 'Multi-line docstring summary should start at the first line' and
#   and it is mutually exclusive with D213. They both relate to the placement of the
#   summary line in a multiline docstring but enforce different styles. D212 requires
#   the summary line to be on the first line after the opening quotes, while D213
#   requires it to be on the second line. A docstring can't simultaneously adhere to
#   both styles, and this project prefers D213.
# NOTE: pydocstyle follows a strict interpretation of PEP 257, enforcing a separate
#   __init__ docstring unless explicitly configured otherwise (D107). pydoclint (with
#   Google-style docstrings) has a mutually exclusive requirement that __init__ methods
#   do not have a docstring at all. For our purposes, it's easier to resolve the
#   conflict by ignoring D107 in pydocstyle.
# NOTE: D200 wants all single line comments to have quotes on the same line, but this
#   can make documentation harder to read when putting the start and end """ on their
